Kernighan-Lin (KL) Algorithm:

The Kernighan-Lin (KL) algorithm is a heuristic algorithm (an iterative improvement technique) for finding partitions of graphs. 
It’s a two-way partitioning algorithm and the partitions must be balanced (of equal size). 
The algorithm has important applications in the layout of digital circuits and components in VLSI. The pseudocode of the KL algorithm can be found online.

Comments on Implementation:

This project was implemented in C++ language using Code::Blocks. Array and many other Data Structures were used to complete the assignment. 
C++ Standard Template Library (STL), such as vectors, iterators, maps, and pairs were also used. Details are given in the code’s comment section.
